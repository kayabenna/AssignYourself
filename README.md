## Our Twist

What sets Assign Yourself apart is the Achievement System, designed to motivate users by tracking progress for each module. This feature rewards timely assignment submissions and encourages users to put their best effort forward. With a dedicated achievement page, students can visualize their milestones and gain an extra incentive to stay on track and excel.
